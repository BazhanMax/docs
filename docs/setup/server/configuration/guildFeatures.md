# Guild Features

Guild features as special modifiers assigned to guilds for additional functionality.

In Fosscord, guild features are stored in the `features` column of the `guilds` table as a comma separated list, with no spaces.
For example, `ANIMATED_ICON,BANNER,DISCOVERABLE`.

A list of all available guild features is available [here](https://gist.github.com/Techy/ecc60b12e94f8fc8185f09b82aa91dd2)

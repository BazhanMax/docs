## What is Fosscord?

Fosscord is a Discord.com server implementation and extension,
with the goal of complete feature parity with Discord.com,
all while adding some additional goodies, security, privacy, and configuration options.

Fosscord allows you to host a complete, Discord.com-compatible chat service
with complete control over it's content, usage, security, configuration, and featureset.
Being Discord.com-compatible, all existing clients, bots, and applications written for
Discord.com can be used on any Fosscord instance, which we believe will be immensely useful
in any transition process between services.

As Fosscord is an entirely separate service from Discord.com, it means a Fosscord server by itself **cannot**
access private data controlled by Discord.com. You **cannot** use a Fosscord server to chat with your friends on Discord.com.
You also **cannot** use a Fosscord server to grant premium ("Nitro") features to a Discord.com account (although you can grant these to a Fosscord account).

Our goal is to achieve complete feature parity with Discord.com, as well as
implement additional security, privacy, and other useful features serverside.
In addition to our server software, we aim to create Fosscord-aware clients that can be used to connect
to multiple Fosscord-compatible instances - including Discord.com - with rich theming and plugin support.
